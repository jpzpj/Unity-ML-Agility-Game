# Unity-ML-Agility-Game
 An agility game playable by Unity Machine Learning

My first Unity project using ML-Agents

The game is a agility game, where you have to try to get a ball into an arc by moving the board. This can be very frrustrating so I wanted to give it a try with Unity ML-Agents after following the excellent Hummingbirds tutorial by Immersive Limt LLC (see https://learn.unity.com/course/ml-agents-hummingbirds)

After several tries I finally succeeded. ML-Agents is able to play the game in an average time less then 6 seconds.
